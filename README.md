# Converting between types in increasingly absurd ways

Code for the [Converting between types in increasingly absurd ways] medium post.

This repo explores different approaches to convert between data classes as a response to and result of a now-deleted StackOverflow question. It uses

- [Reflection and `MethodInfo` invocation],
- [Reflection and Lambda expression compilation],
- [Source generation] and
- [AutoMapper] (because sanity).
